# Cryptoquote

This is a little Python project I did 14+ years ago when I wanted a practical exercise in Python scripting and Tkinter.

Given input text, it creates Cryptoquotes, a [Cryptogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram) of a "famous" quote encoded with a substitution cypher.

IMPORTANT NOTE: These are the code files in their original 14-year-old form and my recollection of how to use them. They don't currently run properly and I need to do a little debugging before you can just pick them up and start cryptoquoting.

## Usage

### From the command line

cryptoquote(inputFilename,outputFilename)

### From the CryptoGUI

1. Run cryptogui_addBrowse.py
2. Specify the names of the input file and output file
3. Click Cryptoquote

## Notes

* I created this on Windows and haven't tested it on other OSes
